## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github

I am student at Washington State University Vancouver (GO COUGS!) for Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. I enjoy tackling technical challenges and turning ideas into practical solutions. I thrive on challenges and quickly adapt to new environments. My love for problem-solving keeps me engaged and driven, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and push my capabilities to deliver impactful solutions. Iâ€™m excited to bring my dedication and passion for excellence to a role where I can contribute meaningfully and grow alongside a dynamic team.
