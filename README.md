## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am student at Washington State University Vancouver (GO COUGS!) for Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. My passion for digital media and technology is not just a career choice, but also an exploration of how these forces shape and influence the world around us. As I advance in my professional journey, I am eager to leverage my skills in marketing, digital media, teamwork, and attention to detail, to contribute to projects that not only drive results but also meaningful change.
